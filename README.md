# Linear-Regression-task3
In this task, I worked on implementing Linear Regression using the Housing Price dataset. The main goal was to understand how house prices can be predicted using different features.
First, I imported the required libraries like Pandas for handling data, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and Scikit-learn for building the regression model. After loading the dataset, I checked the data types, missing values, and overall structure of the dataset.
Some columns had categorical values (like yes/no), so I converted them into numerical format so that the model could process them properly.
Then I separated the features and the target variable (price). I split the dataset into training and testing data. Using the training data, I trained a Linear Regression model and then made predictions on the test data.
To check how well the model performed, I calculated MAE, MSE, and R² score. I also looked at the model coefficients to understand how different features impact the house price.
Through this task, I got practical experience in building and evaluating a regression model and understanding how prediction models work in real-world datasets.
